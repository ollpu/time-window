# Time Window

Display the progression of a show, event (or anything), on any device and screen. Remaining time of the current part is displayed on all of these devices, along with its name and show information. The show is controlled by a host.

Time Window uses Action Cable (new in Rails 5) for communication between the host and the clients.
